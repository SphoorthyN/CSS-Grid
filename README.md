# CSS GRID Practice Exercises and Examples

------

This is a collection of different layouts using CSS grids, both complex and trivial, practice assignments, self-developed layouts as well as my interpretation of different layouts from print media as I keep learning how to use CSS Grids. 

I will try to document each layout as well as I can, but I'm a naturally messy person, so fingers crossed.
